# COVID-19-forecasting
This code uses the COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data repository and fits an ARIMA model to the daily new cases from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021. It then uses the model to make predictions for the number of daily new cases for January 1, 2022 to January 30, 2022. Finally, it plots the training data, testing data, and forecast on a graph.
